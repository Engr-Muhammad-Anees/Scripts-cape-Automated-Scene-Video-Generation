1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,843
Dawn mist above quiet mud houses and

2
00:00:01,843 --> 00:00:03,686
empty dirt streets in a small rural

3
00:00:03,686 --> 00:00:05,530
village

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,287
A barefoot boy in a faded beige

5
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:09,044
shirt stands alone outside a cracked clay

6
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:10,802
house

7
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,560
holding a small cloth bag

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,443
Boy walks slowly through dusty village paths

9
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:16,326
as golden morning light falls across his

10
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:18,210
face

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,650
Old

12
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,090
dry field with cracked earth stretches endlessly

13
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,530
under a pale

14
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,970
colorless sky

15
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,883
Boy kneels on hard ground

16
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:27,796
opens cloth bag

17
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:29,710
revealing a handful of simple seeds

18
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,245
Boy’s eyes reflect rising sun

19
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:34,780
filled with quiet determination and belief

20
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,274
Boy digs into dry soil with bare

21
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:37,769
hands

22
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:39,264
dust coating his skin as the earth

23
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:40,759
resists

24
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,207
Boy carefully places a single seed into

25
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:43,654
the ground

26
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:45,102
covering it with rough

27
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:46,549
dusty fingers

28
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,456
Boy lifts cracked metal pot and pours

29
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:50,363
water onto the soil

30
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:52,269
earth absorbs every drop

31
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:54,366
Dark clouds gather above the field

32
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,463
wind bends dry grass

33
00:00:56,463 --> 00:00:58,559
air grows heavy with anticipation

34
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,775
Rain falls softly

35
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:00,991
then harder

36
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,207
Boy stands still in rain

37
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:03,423
eyes closed

38
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:04,639
face lifted

39
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:06,015
After rain

40
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:07,391
field looks transformed—soft

41
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:08,767
dark

42
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,143
glistening soil under cloudy sky

43
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,519
alive

44
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,864
Tiny green sprout breaks through wet soil

45
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:16,209
fragile and full of hope

46
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,802
Boy sits quietly beside the small sprout

47
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:19,394
at sunset

48
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:20,987
warm light surrounds them

49
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:22,579
gentle smile

50
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:24,112
Days pass

51
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:25,644
skies change

52
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:27,177
seasons shift as the sprout slowly grows

53
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:28,709
into a small plant

54
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,513
Plant becomes a young tree standing firm

55
00:01:30,513 --> 00:01:32,316
in the field

56
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:34,119
leaves move gently in the wind

57
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:35,819
Villagers gather nearby

58
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:37,519
watch the growing tree with curiosity and

59
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,219
amazement

60
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:40,669
Children play and rest in the shade

61
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:42,119
of the tree

62
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,569
laughter fills the air

63
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,049
Years later

64
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:46,530
older boy stands beside tall tree at

65
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,010
golden sunset

66
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,490
looks at it with pride

67
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,405
Village transformed

68
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:53,320
green fields stretch across land

69
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,235
life returns

70
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:57,150
tall tree at center under hopeful sky
